# All Vanilla Assets (AVA)

Adds all (I hope) vanilla models of Transport Fever 2 as placeable assets.
This includes vehicles, cars, houses, trees, campaign stuff etc.

It uses icons instead of names for easy reference (no more guessing what res_1_3x4_02 looks like).

It also allows you to scale the assets, and use the P, O, [ and ] keys to change the slope and pivot.

Houses, Shops and Factories can be configured to act as a cim-magnet.

Certain assets snap to tracks (like locomotives, waggons, etc.)

## Still to do:

- Add ability to turn lights on vehicles on/off
- Add ability to choose colours of certain models
- Better categories ? Depends on feedback: help needed
- Better icons? (I am not good with graphics, any help appreciated)
- Are all models accounted for? (please let me know if I missed one)

Sub-models that look transparent (from one or more sides) have been excluded. (The game builds some models from sub-parts).

## Incompatibility
This mod supercedes any other mod that adds vanilla assets to the game. If I missed one or more, just let me know and I'll add it.
